This project focuses on developing a robust gemstone classification system by employing two cutting-edge deep learning architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT). Inspired by the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale," a ViT model was meticulously crafted from scratch. The project aimed to compare the performance of CNN and ViT in distinguishing between real and fake gemstones.
